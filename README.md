# A Game of Life

A simple pygame toy application that implements [Conway's game of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life). Based off a multitude of pygame tutorials I've found and never wrote down; the functional structure of the App class mostly from [this one](http://pygametutorials.wikidot.com/tutorials-basic).

## Dependancies

Should only require the pygame package to be installed.

## Use

Running game_of_life_cell.py should create a pygame window with a running game of life in it. Left clicking pauses the simulation, right clicking resets it.

## TODO

Get pyinstalled exe generation scripted and working in a self contained manner.
